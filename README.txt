Resident Evil: Director's Cut: DualShock OST - Mansion Basement

This was actually in the international version of
the game. We can thank Takashi Niigaki for this "remaster,"
who ghost-wrote it for Mamoru Samuragouchi.

The development process of RE:DC:DualShock was infamously racked with
problems, from refusal to collaborate with the
previous design lead, to corporate firing
and re-hiring the leads behind each subcommittee at will until the 
employees walked-out, leaving half the graphics, music,
and basic underlying mechanics either missing or hideously unplayable...

On a sincere note:

I'd like to thank Dave for his excellent sprites which, unfortunately,
we could not use due to technical difficulties involving the sprite
collision hit-boxes at the last moment. And my hat goes off to Corey
and Stephen for their work in animation and AI, respectively, 
which unfortunately succumbed to a similar fate involving
the final implementation in our main repo when code was combined.

I'd also like to thank Mirai Moon at supersmashbrosfanon for
our single mario.png image. Although we couldn't get it to animate,
we felt it had the most charisma out of all of the clones. Thank you!

Heres to open source!
